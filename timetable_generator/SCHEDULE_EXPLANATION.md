### **2. Extended Daily Hours** ⏰
**New Schedule:** 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM (instead of 9 AM - 7 PM)

| Slot # | Time | Duration | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | **08:00 - 09:30** | 1.5 hours | 🌅 **Early morning slot** (NEW) |

## 🔍 **What does "(cont.)" mean?**

### **Lab Session Explanation:**

**Lab sessions require 2 consecutive time slots (3 hours total):**

#### **Example: CS163 Data Structures Lab**
```
Wednesday:
  08:00-09:30: CS163-Lab-A | Lab-1           ← First 1.5 hours
  09:45-11:15: CS163-Lab-A (cont.) | Lab-1   ← Continuation (second 1.5 hours)
```

**Breakdown:**
- **Slot 1:** `CS163-Lab-A | Lab-1` = First part of lab (1.5 hours)
- **Slot 2:** `CS163-Lab-A (cont.) | Lab-1` = **Continuation** of same lab (1.5 hours)
- **Total:** 3 hours for complete lab session

**"(cont.)" = Continuation** - It marks that this is the **second half** of the same lab session, not a new lab.

## 📊 **Weekly Schedule Capacity**

### **Total Available Slots:**
- **Days:** 5 (Monday - Friday)
- **Slots per day:** 6 teaching slots (excluding lunch)

## ⚠️ **Why Some Courses Couldn't Be Scheduled?**

### **Problem: Too Many Electives in Semester 6**

**Semester 6 Challenge:**
- **15+ elective courses** per section
- Each elective: **3-4 lectures + 1 tutorial** = 4-5 sessions
- **Total:** 60-75 sessions needed
- **Available:** Only 30 slots per week

**Math:**
```
Required slots: 60-75 sessions
Available slots: 30 slots (5 days × 6 slots)
Shortfall: 30-45 sessions can't fit
```

### **Unscheduled Course Categories:**

#### **1. Advanced CS Electives:**
- CS462, CS469, CS472 (Advanced topics)
- These have 3 lectures + 1 tutorial each = 4 sessions

#### **2. Data Science Electives:**
- DS351, DS355, DS356, DS357
- Multiple DSAI students taking these

#### **3. Cross-Disciplinary Electives:**
- EC361, EC362 (Electronics electives for CS students)
- PH352, PH353 (Physics electives)
- ASD351 (Design electives)
- HS159, HS154, HS155, HS156 (Humanities electives)

## 💡 **Solutions for Unscheduled Courses**

### **Option 1: Elective Modules** 📅
Split semester into modules:
- **Module 1 (Weeks 1-7):** Schedule first half of electives
- **Module 2 (Weeks 8-14):** Schedule second half of electives
- Students take 2-3 electives per module instead of all at once

### **Option 2: Online/Hybrid Classes** 💻
- Move some electives to **online format**
- Asynchronous lectures + weekly synchronous tutorials
- Frees up physical classroom slots

### **Option 3: Evening/Weekend Classes** 🌙
- Add **Friday evening** sessions (after 6 PM)
- Optional **Saturday morning** sessions (for electives only)
- Only for high-demand electives

### **Option 4: Alternative Schedules** 🔄
- **Bi-weekly classes:** Some electives meet every other week (3-hour sessions)
- **Block scheduling:** Intensive week-long modules
- **Summer electives:** Offer some electives in summer term

### **Option 5: Reduce Electives** ✂️
- Students choose **2-3 electives instead of 5-6**
- Prioritize core electives over exploratory ones
- Offer remaining electives in next semester

## 💬 **FAQs**

### **Q1: Why do labs show "(cont.)"?**
**A:** Labs are 3 hours long, need 2 consecutive 1.5-hour slots. The second slot is marked "(cont.)" to show it's a continuation, not a new lab.

### **Q2: Why no Saturday classes?**
**A:** As per your request! Schedule now uses Monday-Friday only with extended daily hours.

### **Q3: Why are some courses unscheduled?**
**A:** Too many electives in Semester 6 (60+ sessions) for available slots (30 slots). Need alternative arrangements.

### **Q4: Can I see which courses are unscheduled?**
**A:** Yes! When you run `py csv_timetable_generator.py`, terminal shows complete list of unscheduled courses.

### **Q5: What's the difference between Lab-1 and C202?**
**A:** 
- **Lab-1, Lab-2, etc.** = Computer/practical labs (for lab sessions)
- **C202, C104, etc.** = Classrooms (for lectures & tutorials)

### **Q6: Why classes from 8 AM to 8 PM?**
**A:** To fit maximum courses in 5 days without Saturday. Early morning (8 AM) and evening (6-8 PM) slots added for flexibility.
