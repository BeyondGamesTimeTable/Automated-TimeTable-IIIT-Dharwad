##  Input File Format

Place CSV files in `timetable_generator/input_files/sdtt_inputs/`:

```csv
Course,Faculty,Session Type,Hours per Week,After Midsems
DSA,Prof. Kumar,Lecture,3,No
DSA,Prof. Kumar,Tutorial,1,No
DSA Lab,Prof. Kumar,Lab,2,No
ML Elective,Prof. Sharma,Lecture,3,Yes
```

- `Faculty` - Faculty name (for conflict checking)
- `Session Type` - Lecture/Tutorial/Lab
- `Hours per Week` - Weekly hours
- `After Midsems` - Yes/No (for elective rotation)

---

##  Customization

### Modify Time Slots
Edit time slots in the generator code:
```python
TIME_SLOTS = [
    '09:00-10:00', '10:00-11:00', '11:00-12:00',
    '12:00-13:00',  # Lunch
    '14:00-15:00', '15:00-16:00', '16:00-17:00',
    '17:00-18:00', '18:30-20:00'  # Evening
]
```

### Enable Saturday for More Departments
Modify department configuration to include Saturday scheduling for high-load semesters.

### Adjust Classroom Capacities
Update classroom list in configuration for exam seating optimization.

---

##  Known Limitations

**Unscheduled Sessions**: 17 out of 582 (2.9%) require manual scheduling due to:
- High concurrent load in some semesters
- Faculty availability conflicts
- Limited classroom capacity during peak hours

**Solution**: Use evening slots (18:30-20:00) or Saturday for overflow sessions.

---

##  Troubleshooting

### HTML Navigation Errors
**Issue**: Back buttons not working  
**Fix**: Ensure proper file structure - open `index.html` from project root

### Buttons Not Displaying
**Issue**: Styling not applied  
**Fix**: Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R) and reload

### Generation Errors
**Issue**: `pandas not found`  
**Fix**: `pip install pandas`

### Performance Issues
**Issue**: Slow browser with 324 charts  
**Fix**: Open charts one session at a time, use Chrome/Firefox/Edge 120+
